## Quiz Generation: Seed â†’ Recipe â†’ LLM Pipeline

Trivia Wizard uses a deterministic recipe system for quiz generation:

1. **Seed Generation**
   - **Daily Quizzes**: Deterministic seed based on `date + category` (same inputs = same recipe)
   - **Practice Quizzes**: Random 32-byte seed (unique recipe every time)

2. **Recipe Building**
   A recipe is deterministically generated from the seed and includes:
   - **Tone**: scholarly, playful, cinematic, pub_quiz, deadpan, sports_banter
   - **Era**: ancient, medieval, early_modern, modern, contemporary, mixed
   - **Region**: global, americas, europe, asia
   - **Difficulty Curve**: 3 predefined patterns (ramp, wave, valley)
   - **Distractor Styles**: close_shaves, same_category, temporal_confusion, numerical_nearby
   - **Explanation Style**: one_line_fact, compare_contrast, mini_story, why_wrong

3. **LLM Generation**
   The LLM receives the recipe as constraints and generates questions matching the specified tone, era, region, and difficulty progression. The LLM **never decides config** - it only fills content based on the deterministic recipe.

**Why this approach?**
- Daily quizzes are reproducible (same recipe for the same day's challenge)
- Practice quizzes have infinite variety (random recipes)
- No free-form config strings - all parameters are predefined enums
- Large permutation space ensures unique quiz experiences
